.SH NAME
@SECURITYDIR@/@PACKAGE@/pam_krb5_cchelper \- Credential cache helper

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam_krb5_cchelper [-c|-u|-d] [ccname] [uid] [gid]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The pam_krb5.so module uses pam_krb5_cchelper to create, update, and remove
credential caches.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP -c|-u|-d
A flag indicating whether the helper is expected to create, update, or
destroy a ccache.  When creating a ccache, the \fIccname\fP argument
should be a name or a pattern ending in XXXXXX.  When updating or deleting a
ccache, the \fIccname\fP argument should be the name of an extant ccache.

.IP ccname
A credential cache name or name pattern of the form
\fITYPE\fR:\fI@default_ccache_dir@/foo or
\fITYPE\fR:\fI@default_ccache_dir@/fooXXXXXX\fR.

.IP uid
An optional numeric UID which the helper will attempt to switch to before
creating a ccache.  The helper continues in its task if the attempt fails.

.IP gid
An optional numeric GID which the helper will attempt to switch to before
creating a ccache.  The helper continues in its task if the attempt fails.

.SH OPERATION
The helper will read contents from its standard input.
.br
If input of suitable length is not read, the specified credential cache is
deleted.
.br
If input of suitable length is read, a temporary file is created and the input
is stored to the file.  If TYPE is FILE, the file's name will be based on the
pattern and the name of this new credential cache will be printed.  If TYPE is
not FILE, a new credential cache will be created and the contents of the
temporary file will be treated as a credential cache whose contents will be
copied into the new credential cache, whose name will be printed.
