- 2.4.8: * handle when the [libdefaults] default_ccache_name setting is not set
- 2.4.7: * try to read the [libdefaults] default_ccache_name setting, and
	   handle the %{uid}, %{euid}, %{userid}, and %{username} substitutions
	 * stop trying to fix ownership on keyring ccaches, since we stopped
	   having to worry about it around 2.4.0
- 2.4.6: * fix handling of ccaches for users who are mapped to principal
	   names in a realm other than the configured default realm (#999604)
- 2.4.5: * handle ccname templates that don't include a template suffix
	   by accepting the location at create-time if the permissions
	   look right, and not deleting the creds at cleanup-time
	 * fix some memory leaks
- 2.4.4: * compilation fixes
- 2.4.3: * translation updates
- 2.4.2: * handle different function signatures for krb5_trace_callback
	 * avoid overriding the primary when updating DIR: caches

           for the sake of login (#822493)
- 2.3.13:* don't bother creating a v5 ccache in "external" mode
	 * add a "trace" option to enable libkrb5 tracing, if available
	 * avoid trying to get password-change creds twice
	 * use an in-memory ccache when obtaining tokens using v5 creds
	 * turn off creds==session in "sshd"
- 2.3.12:* add a "validate_user_user" option to control trying to perform
	   user-to-user authentication to validate TGTs when a keytab is not
	   available
	 * add an "ignore_k5login" option to control whether or not the module
	   will use the krb5_kuserok() function to perform additional
	   authorization checks
	 * turn on validation by default - verify_ap_req_nofail controls how we
	   treat errors reading keytab files now
	 * add an "always_allow_localname" option when we can use
	   krb5_aname_to_localname() to second-guess the krb5_kuserok() check
	 * prefer krb5_change_password() to krb5_set_password()
- 2.3.11:* create credentials before trying to look up the location of the

- 2.3.10:* fine-tune the logic for selecting which key we use for validating
	   credentials
- 2.3.9: * add a "multiple_ccaches" option to allow forcing the previous

	   one, but saving them until the call that caused us to create
	   them is reversed
- 2.3.8: * add a "chpw_prompt" option to allow password changes to happen
	   during what the calling application thinks is just a password
	   check, to work around applications that don't handle the case
	   of an expired password correctly (#509092, based on patch from
	   Olivier Fourdan)
- 2.3.7: * when refreshing credentials, store the new creds in the default
	   ccache if $KRB5CCNAME isn't set (#507984)
- 2.3.6: * prefer a "host" key, if one is found, when validating TGTs
	   (#450776)
- 2.3.5: * make prompting behavior for non-existent accounts and users who
	   just press enter match up with those who aren't/don't (#502602,
	   CVE-2009-1384)
- 2.3.4: * don't request password-changing credentials using the same options
	   we use for ticket-granting tickets
- 2.3.3: * close a couple of open pipes to defunct processes, fix a couple
	   of debug messages
- 2.3.2: * fix ccache permissions bypass when the "existing_ticket" option is
	   used (CVE-2008-3825, which affects 2.2.0-2.2.25, 2.3.0, and 2.3.1)
- 2.3.1: * make afs5log's -n option actually work the "null_afs" option
	 * translations for messages!
- 2.3.0: * added the ability to set up tokens in the rxk5 format
	 * added the "token_strategy" option to control which methods we'll
	   try to use for setting tokens
	 * merge "null_afs" functionality from Jan Iven
- 2.2.23: * when we're changing passwords, force at least one attempt to
	    authenticate using the KDC, even in the pathological case where
	    there's no previously- entered password and we were told not to ask
	    for one (#400611)
- 2.2.22: * moved .k5login checks to a subprocess to avoid screwing with the
	    parent process's tokens and PAG (fallout from #371761)
	  * all options which took true/false before ("debug", "tokens", and
	    so on) can now take service names
- 2.2.21: * fix permissions problems on keyring ccaches, so that users can write
	    to them after we've set them up, and we can still do the cleanup
	  * fix permission problems accessing .k5login files in home directories
	    which live in AFS (#371761)
- 2.2.20: * fixes for credential refreshing
	  * avoid running afoul of SELinux policy when attempting to get tokens
- 2.2.19: * the "keytab" option can now be used to specify a custom location
	    for a given service from within krb5.conf
	  * log messages are now logged with facility LOG_AUTHPRIV (or LOG_AUTH
	    if LOG_AUTHPRIV is not defined) instead of the application's default
	    or LOG_USER
	  * added the "pkinit_identity" option to provide a way to specify
	    where the user's public-key credentials are, and "pkinit_flags" to
	    specify arbitrary flags for libkrb5 (Heimdal only)
	  * added the "preauth_options" option to provide a way to specify
	    arbitrary preauthentication options to libkrb5 (MIT only)
	  * added the "ccname_template" option to provide a way to specify
	    where the user's credentials should be stored, so that KEYRING:
	    credential caches can be deployed at will.
- 2.2.18: * fix permissions-related problems creating v4 ticket files
- 2.2.17: * corrected a typo in the pam_krb5(8) man page
	  * clarified that the "tokens" flag should only be needed for
	    applications which are not using PAM correctly
	  * clarified COPYING and .spec file to better reflect licensing as
	    indicated in the source files
- 2.2.16: * don't bother using a helper for creating v4 ticket files when we're
	    just getting tokens
	  * clean up the debug message which we emit when we do v5->v4
	    principal name conversion
	  * compilation fixes
- 2.2.15: * let default "external" and "use_shmem" settings be specified at
	    compile-time
	  * correctly return a "unknown user" error when attempting to change
	    a password for a user who has no corresponding principal (#235020)
	  * don't bother using a helper for creating ccache files, which we're
	    just going to delete, when we need to get tokens
- 2.2.14: * handle "client revoked" errors
- 2.2.13: * make it possible to have more than one ccache (and tktfile) at a
	    time to work around apps which open a session, set the environment,
	    and initialize creds (when we previously created a ccache, removing
	    the one which was named in the environment) (#204939)
- 2.2.12: * add a "pwhelp" option.  Display the KDC error to users.
- 2.2.11: * return success from our account management callback in cases where
	    our authentication callback simply failed to authenticate (#207410)
	  * fix setting of items for password-changing modules which get called
	    after us (Michael Calmer)
- 2.2.10: * add the "no_subsequent_prompt" option, to force the module to
	    always answer a libkrb5 prompt with the PAM_AUTHTOK value
	  * add the "debug_sensitive" option, which actually logs passwords
	  * add the --with-os-distribution option to configure to override
	    "Red Hat Linux" in the man pages
	  * if the server returns an error message during password-changing,
	    let the user see it
- 2.2.9: * return PAM_IGNORE instead of PAM_SERVICE_ERR when we're called in
	   an unsafe situation and told to refresh credentials
	 * fix a race condition in how the ccache creation helper is invoked
	 * properly handle "external" cases where the forwarded creds belong
	   to someone other than the principal name we guessed for the user
- 2.2.8: * skip attempts to set non-"2b" tokens when use of v4 credentials
           has been completely disabled
- 2.2.7: * do 524 conversion for the "external" cases, too
- 2.2.6: * add "krb4_use_as_req" to completely disallow any attempts to get
           v4 credentials (along with "krb4_convert_524", which was already
           there)
         * don't try to convert v5 creds to v4 creds for AFS when
           "krb4_convert_524" is disabled, either
- 2.2.5: * fix a couple of cases where a debug message would be logged even if
           debugging wasn't enabled
- 2.2.4: * fix reporting of the reasons for password change failures
- 2.2.3: * fix a compilation error
- 2.2.2: * when validating user credentials, don't leak the keytab file
           descriptor
- 2.2.1: * fix a thinko which broke afs5log on systems where the AFS syscall
           isn't available
- 2.2: * refreshing of preexisting credentials works, so unlocking your
         screensaver should fetch new credentials and tokens.  Be careful that
         you don't invoke the authentication function with the "tokens" flag,
         which creates a new PAG, if you want this to be useful.
         As of this writing, at least xscreensaver calls pam_setcred() with the
         proper flag to signal that credentials should be refreshed.  Other
         screen saver applications may not.
       * new "external" option for use with OpenSSH's GSSAPI authentication
         with credential delegation and AFS, *should* work with anything which
         uses GSSAPI, accepts delegated credentials, and sets KRB5CCNAME in
         the PAM environment
       * new "use_shmem" option for use with OpenSSH's privilege separation mode
       * credential and renewal lifetimes can now be given either as krb5-style
         times or as numbers of seconds
       * new "ignore_unknown_principal"/"ignore_unknown_spn" option
       * new "krb4_convert_524" option
       * configure can now set the default location of the system keytab
       * configure disables AFS support except on Linux and Solaris (for now),
         but can be overridden either way (needs testing on Solaris)
       * can now specify a principal name for AFS cells, to save guesswork
       * should now correctly work with SAM authentication, needs testing
       * "tokens" now behaves like "external" and "use_shmem", in that it
         can be specified in the configuration as a list of service names
- 2.1: switch to a minikafs implementation to flush out lurking ABI differences
  between the krb4 interface the kafs library used and the one which libkrb4
  provides.  Also, we support "2b" tokens now.
- 2.0: more or less complete rewrite.
  Jettison our own krb5.conf parsing code in favor of the supported API.
  This means that configuration settings which look like this:
  [pam]
    forwardable = yes
  are no longer recognized, and must be changed to:
  [appdefaults]
    pam = {
      forwardable = yes
    }
